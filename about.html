    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>CSS for All was started in the beautiful Hudson Valley in Upstate New York ten years ago - it's been a while!
      <br><br>
      Jacob Berg, Alan Blue, and Ivan Alvisovich recognized the need to bring quality, professional CSS guides to the bursting world of web design.

          <p>I'm Jake!</p>
          <p>I'm from Rhinebeck, New York and attend Binghamton University where I study math. I started programming in 2017 when I first took a C++ course at Dutchess Community College. Since then, I've known that this is my passion. I try to study a little bit of everything, but there is never enough time.</p>
          <p>Right now, I am focusing on learning web development with Ruby on Rails as the backend.</p>

        <p>I've been working as a front-end developer for the last twelve years (not to date myself). When I first began, CSS was not the beautiful, established markup language that it is today - we used floats to position everything! That sucked. But now there's flexbox and grid.</p>
        <p>Check out my tutorials on them. Using them in your webpage can save hours of time.</p>

        <p>I'm Ivan, the old one.</p>
        <p>In my day, web development meant you hadn't cleaned your basement in a while! The first language I learned to express my thoughts in was binary - and that sucked way more than using floats to position elements on the page. Trust me.</p>
        <p>I spend my days smoking a pipe, dressing up like I'm a pseudo-adventurer, and writing bitchin' stylesheets</p>
